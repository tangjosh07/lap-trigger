# Infrared Lap Trigger System

An embedded system designed to provide reliable lap timing for Formula SAE vehicle testing.

## Overview
This project implements an infrared lap trigger using a photodiode-based detection circuit and an STM32 microcontroller. The system is designed to reliably detect vehicle passes under varying lighting conditions and noise levels during track testing.
